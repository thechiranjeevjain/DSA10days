     * 🧩 Difficulty:
     * Hard
     *
     * 🏷️ Tags:
     * Array, Two Pointers, Stack, Dynamic Programming, Monotonic Stack
     *
     * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Problem Statement:
     *
     * Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width
     * of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.
     *
     * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Example 1:
     *
     * Input:
     * height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
     *
     * Output:
     * 6
     *
     * Explanation:
     * The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array
     * [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section)
     * are being trapped.
     *
     * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Example 2:
     *
     * Input:
     * height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
     *
     * Output:
     * 9
     *
     * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Constraints:
     *
     * n == height.length
     * 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4
     * 0 <= height[i] <= 10^5
     *
     * ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     * Notes:
     * - Water can only be trapped between bars.
     * - Each bar has width exactly 1.
     * - The elevation map is fixed; rain falls uniformly.

     * 🔵 CORE PATTERN OVERVIEW (INVARIANT-FIRST · FULL)
     * ============================================================================
     *
     * 🔵 Pattern Name:
     * Boundary-Constrained Accumulation (Two-Sided Maximum Invariant)
     *
     * 🔵 Problem Archetype:
     * For each position, compute a value constrained by the minimum of two
     * opposing boundaries while subtracting the local height.
     *
     * 🟢 Core Invariant (MANDATORY — ONE SENTENCE):
     * At every index i, the water trapped is determined solely by the minimum of
     * the maximum height to its left and the maximum height to its right.
     *
     * 🟡 Why This Invariant Makes the Pattern Work:
     * Water cannot exceed the shorter boundary; any taller boundary is irrelevant.
     * This invariant localizes a global-looking problem into independent columns.
     *
     * 🟢 When This Pattern Applies:
     * - Trapped water / bounded area problems
     * - Problems where constraints come from both directions
     * - Elevation / histogram / skyline interpretations
     *
     * 🧭 Pattern Recognition Signals:
     * - “How much can be trapped”
     * - “Between bars”
     * - Need for left and right context
     * - Independent per-index contribution
     *
     * 🟣 How This Pattern Differs from Similar Patterns:
     * - Unlike monotonic stack for span problems, here the invariant is symmetric.
     * - Unlike prefix-sum problems, accumulation depends on *future* maxima.
     * - Unlike greedy local rules, correctness comes from global boundaries.

     * 🟢 MENTAL MODEL & INVARIANTS (CANONICAL SOURCE OF TRUTH)
     * ============================================================================
     *
     * 🟢 Mental Model (THINKING, NOT CODE):
     * Imagine filling water column by column.
     * Each column can only hold water up to the height of the shorter wall
     * surrounding it from the left and the right.
     *
     * 🟢 State Representation:
     * - height[i]        → elevation at index i
     * - maxLeft[i]       → maximum height strictly to the left of i (inclusive)
     * - maxRight[i]      → maximum height strictly to the right of i (inclusive)
     * - waterAtI         → min(maxLeft[i], maxRight[i]) - height[i]
     *
     * 🟢 ALL Invariants (EXPLICIT):
     *
     * Invariant 1:
     * maxLeft[i] is the tallest bar from index 0 to i.
     *
     * Invariant 2:
     * maxRight[i] is the tallest bar from index i to n-1.
     *
     * Invariant 3:
     * If min(maxLeft[i], maxRight[i]) <= height[i], then waterAtI = 0.
     *
     * Invariant 4:
     * Water contribution at index i is independent of all other indices
     * once maxLeft and maxRight are known.
     *
     * 🟡 Allowed Moves (Preserve Invariant):
     * - Precompute prefix maximums
     * - Precompute suffix maximums
     * - Two-pointer traversal maintaining running maxes
     *
     * 🔴 Forbidden Moves (Break Correctness):
     * - Using nearest greater instead of maximum
     * - Using stack values instead of indices incorrectly
     * - Letting local comparisons override global maxima
     *
     * 🟡 Termination Logic:
     * - Finite array
     * - Each index contributes once
     * - No cyclic dependency
     *
     * 🔴 Why Common Alternatives Are Inferior:
     * - Local greedy fails because water depends on *farthest* boundary
     * - Stack misuse often computes spans, not volume

     * 🔴 WHY THE NAIVE / WRONG SOLUTION FAILS (FORENSIC ANALYSIS)
     * ============================================================================
     *
     * 🔴 Typical Wrong Approach #1:
     * Using nearest greater element on left and right.
     *
     * Why It Seems Correct:
     * - Intuition says “water is trapped by nearest walls”.
     *
     * Why It Fails:
     * - Water does NOT care about nearest wall.
     * - It cares about the TALLEST wall on each side.
     *
     * Exact Invariant Violated:
     * Violates Invariant 1 & 2 — uses local boundary instead of global maximum.
     *
     * Minimal Counterexample:
     * height = [5, 0, 1, 0, 2]
     *
     * Nearest greater on right of index 1 is 1,
     * but actual right boundary is 5 (farther).
     *
     * 🔴 Typical Wrong Approach #2:
     * Stack storing heights instead of indices.
     *
     * Why It Seems Correct:
     * - Monotonic stack feels “advanced”.
     *
     * Why It Fails:
     * - Volume depends on distance (width), not just height.
     * - Height-only stacks lose positional information.
     *
     * 🔴 Interviewer Trap:
     * They let you pass small cases,
     * then give a valley with distant tall walls.
     *
     * 🔴 Your Failing Solution (POST-MORTEM):
     *
     * - You used Stack<Integer> of heights.
     * - You attempted to compute “leftGreater” and “rightGreater”.
     * - You popped based on <= comparison.
     *
     * Fatal Issues:
     * ❌ You stored heights, not indices.
     * ❌ You computed nearest smaller/greater, not maximum.
     * ❌ You allowed popping to overwrite boundaries.
     * ❌ You assumed min(leftGreater, rightGreater) always valid.
     *
     * Result:
     * The core invariant was never enforced.

     * 🟣 Discard / Transition Logic:

     * Reinforcement Problem 2: Trapping Rain Water II (2D)
     * --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     *
     * Full Problem Statement:
     * Given an m x n matrix of non-negative integers representing an elevation map,
     * compute how much water it can trap after raining.
     *
     * Pattern Mapping:
     * Same invariant generalized to 2D using a min-heap.
     *
     * Interview Note:
     * Boundary-first expansion preserves the invariant.
     *
     * (Code omitted intentionally — requires priority queue and grid traversal;
     * conceptually same invariant but structurally heavier.)

     * 11️⃣ 🟢 LEARNING VERIFICATION (INVARIANT-FIRST)
     * ============================================================================
     *
     * 🟢 Invariant to Recall (Without Code):
     * Water at index i is limited by the shorter of the tallest bar on its left
     * and the tallest bar on its right.
     *
     * 🔴 Why Naive Approaches Fail:
     * - Nearest greater element ≠ tallest boundary
     * - Local reasoning ignores distant constraints
     *
     * 🔴 Bugs to Debug Intentionally:
     * - Replace max with nearest greater → wrong
     * - Advance larger pointer first → wrong
     * - Use heights instead of indices in stack → wrong
     *
     * 🧭 How to Detect This Invariant in Unseen Problems:
     * Ask:
     * “Is the answer at each position bounded by two opposing global constraints?”

     * 🧘 FINAL CLOSURE STATEMENT (PROBLEM-SPECIFIC)
     * ============================================================================
     *
     * For this problem, the invariant is that trapped water at any index is bounded
     * by the shorter of the tallest bars on its left and right.
     *
     * The answer represents the sum of all such bounded excess heights.
     *
     * The search terminates because each index is processed exactly once while
     * maintaining valid boundaries.
     *
     * I can re-derive this solution under pressure by stating the invariant first.
     *
     * This chapter is complete.
     *
     * 📌 Rule to prevent over-study:
     * If I can explain the invariant and the discard rule, I am done.
